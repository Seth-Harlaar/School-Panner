# school_planner [WIP]

This project shows my journey in cross-platform application development journey using Flutter, driven by a passion for learning Dartâ€”a language blending C-style syntax with object-oriented features and null safety. This initiative reflects a dedicated effort to broaden software development horizons into the realm of app creation.


### Curent state:
- Currently the app uses Isar to store data locally: https://isar.dev/
- The user can create **classes** which can be used to keep track of assessments (with options for tests, labs, and assignments) and have their grade calculated based on finished and unfinished assignments
- Assessments can be made for each class which include details like title, description, type, weight, progress, due date, and final grade
- The app also features a notes app, which users can use to create new notes to keep track of information or take notes during class, and view old notes that they have created

### End goal features
This project has a very large scope. I have high hopes and intend to implement the following features:
- working calender with events
- list of courses with assessments, grade calculations
- notes page
- priority matrix page - recommended order of coursework
- appealing ui, potentially themed to certain schools
